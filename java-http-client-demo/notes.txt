1. Basic HTTP Requests with HttpClient
GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD

Handling query parameters, headers, and body

Sending JSON, XML, and form data

Setting timeouts (connection and read timeouts)

2. Advanced Features of HttpClient
Handling cookies, redirects, and authentication (Basic, Digest, Bearer token)

Setting custom request headers (e.g., User-Agent, Authorization)

Error handling (timeouts, HTTP errors, retries)

Connection pooling and performance optimizations

SSL/TLS configurations for secure communication

3. Setting Up WireMockServer
Setting up WireMock to run locally in Docker (as youâ€™ve done already)

Understanding how WireMock works (stubbing, mocking, verification)

Creating mappings and response files for various scenarios (status codes, headers, delays, etc.)

4. WireMock - Basic Operations
Creating simple stubs for GET/POST/PUT/DELETE requests

Returning mock responses with custom headers, body, and status codes

Working with query parameters and path variables in WireMock

5. Advanced WireMock Features
Response templating (dynamic content in response bodies)

Simulating latency, failures, or service down scenarios

Working with request/response matchers (e.g., JSON body, headers, query params)

Using WireMock for contract testing

Verifying interactions (request counts, request body, etc.)

6. Using WireMock to Simulate Real-World Services
Mocking third-party services and APIs (e.g., payment gateways, external REST APIs)

Simulating 404/500 errors, timeouts, slow responses, etc.

Using WireMock to simulate rate-limited services or API errors

7. Testing with HttpClient and WireMock
Writing tests to verify interaction between your HttpClient and WireMock server

Verifying request headers, body, and status codes in tests

Setting up WireMock stubs to simulate API responses

Handling timeouts and retries in tests using WireMock

8. Integration with Frameworks (Optional but beneficial)
Integrating WireMock with JUnit 5 for unit and integration tests

Using WireMock with Spring Boot (e.g., @WireMockRule for integration testing)

Using WireMock in CI/CD pipelines for automated testing

Creating a mock HTTP server for automated testing (e.g., for microservices)

9. Debugging and Logging
Logging requests and responses for debugging purposes

WireMock logging and access to logs for troubleshooting

Understanding WireMock's verbose mode and how to enable it

10. Performance and Scalability
Scaling WireMock for larger projects or high request volumes

Understanding how to configure WireMock for production-like environments

Managing large numbers of mock requests and stubs efficiently
